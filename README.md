# Chronicles of Construction

A digital archive documenting architectural materiality and construction techniques throughout history.

This repository serves as a collaborative digital archive for studying the interplay of materials, techniques, and cultural context in significant buildings throughout history. It aims to provide structured case studies that explore how material choices shape architectural expression and reflect human desires for permanence and beauty. Contributors are invited to document buildings using a standardized template to facilitate comparative analysis.
